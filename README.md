_April 23, 2024_

Organization:
* SDX-ch23: The code files for the _SDX Ch. 23_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 

## Team Members for Part 1
Andrew Tate, John Leeds

## Team Roles for Part 1
Who will start out as
* DRIVER: John Leeds
* NAVIGATOR: Andrew Tate

You will switch halfway through this activity.

## Part 1 Documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 23?
    * Curses
    * How to not use inheritance
    * Using a global variable to log
    * Clipping and windowing
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
    * The logging is kind of confusing.
    * The inheritance makes it hard to read.

## Exercise 0: Run the code

Let's start by running the 6 final versions of the code from 
the conclusions of sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

As you go along, review the code you are running and address the questions 
in the exercises.

### Section 1: Curses
Run
    python3 show_lines.py 5 logfile

Verify that you see white text on a black screen. 
Typing `q` should quit the program.

Try increasing the number of lines to 10 and verify you see ten lines of text.

Then increasing the number of lines to 50 and verify the program crashes as described.

* Why does `open_log` need the line `global LOG`? What happens if it is removed?
    * It worked but 50 crashed üòä
    * `open_log` needs the `global LOG` because `LOG` is global and it is being modified.
* Why doesn‚Äôt the `log` function need this statement?
    * `LOG` is not being modified.

### Section 2: Windowing
Run
    python3 cursor_const.py 5 logfile
    python3 cursor_const.py 50 logfile

* This version should not crash. But can you see 50 lines of text? Why or why not?
    * See this part of the reading: "The solution is to create a Window class that knows how big the screen is and only displays lines (or parts of lines) that fit inside it"

### Section 3: Moving
Run 
    python3 move_cursor.py 10 logfile

Verify that there is a cursor that moves along with the arrow keys, 
and you can move the cursor outside the bounds of the displayed text.
If you move the cursor outside the window, the viewer will crash.

Consider it verified! ‚úÖ

### Section 4: Refactoring
Run 
    python3 buffer_class.py 10 logfile
and verify that it behaves exactly like the previous version 
- as it should, since it is only a refactoring. 

Consider it verified! ‚úÖ

* What are all the classes defined in this version of the file viewer application?
    * `Pretend`, `DispatchApp`, `Buffer`, `BufferApp`
* What are the factory methods?
    * Please search for them with the following regular expression: "def \_make\_*(self):"
* Why do you think the author paused here to refactor before fixing the 
bugs in the previous version of the code?
    * He was dropped on his head as a kid. ‚òπÔ∏è

### Section 5: Clipping
Run
    python3 clip_fixed.py 10 logfile
Verify that the cursor does not move outside the bounds of the text.

* However, there is another bug. What is it? (If necessary, use `CTRL-C` to interrupt the program.)
    * Unfortunately, I can no longer press the "q" button to quit the program, which was previously a handy feature.
* What are all the classes defined in this version of the file viewer application?
    * `ClipCursor`, `ClipBuffer`, `ClipApp`, `ClipCursorFixed`.
    * That's so many!

### Section 6: Viewport
Run
    python3 viewport.py 50 logfile
Verify that you can scroll vertically through the text.

Consider it verified! ‚úÖ

* What are all the classes defined in this version of the file viewer application?
    * `ViewPortBuffer`, `ViewPortApp`, `ViewPortCursor`
* Taking the file viewer application as a whole, do you find the code easy or difficult to read and understand? Why or why not? You might consider Ousterhout's idea of "classitis."
    * This is difficult to understand because there are so many classes. I diagnose Greg Wilson with classitis.  Because this code has not been released, there is not as much harm in changing previous code instead of making a new class.

## Exercise 1: Quitting the application

In the file `dispatch_keys.py`, add a method to the `DispatchApp` class so that once again you can type `q` to quit the application.

We did it!

## Exercise 2: Horizontal scrolling

Modify the application to scroll horizontally as well as vertically.

Rather than creating yet another version of the app with 
yet more child classes, you can modify the code in `viewport.py`

We tried to do this but it did not work.

## Exercise 3: Line numbers

Modify the file viewer to show line numbers on the left side of the text.
The line numbers should not move when scrolling horizontally.

We got line numbers! Bingo!
