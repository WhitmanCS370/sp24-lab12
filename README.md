## Part 1 Documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 23?
The chapter discussed building a text terminal. He walked through the implementation of different aspect of the terminal, including a cursor, window sizing, and scrolling through the terminal. The reading also discussed using inhertiance to refactor, as well as factory methods.
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
We were similarly confused about the author's decision making process for refactoring, and why he chose to add inhertance rather than adjusting existing code.

## Exercise 0: Run the code

Let's start by running the 6 final versions of the code from 
the conclusions of sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

As you go along, review the code you are running and address the questions 
in the exercises.

### Section 1: Curses
Run
    python3 show_lines.py 5 logfile

Verify that you see white text on a black screen. 
Typing `q` should quit the program.

Try increasing the number of lines to 10 and verify you see ten lines of text.

Then increasing the number of lines to 50 and verify the program crashes as described.

* Why does `open_log` need the line `global LOG`? What happens if it is removed?
It needs the line `global LOG` because if it used in the function without being declared as a global, it will be treated as a local variable within the function.
* Why doesnâ€™t the `log` function need this statement?
Because the `log` function does make a variable declaration, but rather accesses the global variable.

### Section 2: Windowing
Run
    python3 cursor_const.py 5 logfile
    python3 cursor_const.py 50 logfile

* This version should not crash. But can you see 50 lines of text? Why or why not?
No, because the window is too small and the user is unable to scroll vertically through the lines.

### Section 3: Moving
Run 
    python3 move_cursor.py 10 logfile

Verify that there is a cursor that moves along with the arrow keys, 
and you can move the cursor outside the bounds of the displayed text.
If you move the cursor outside the window, the viewer will crash.

### Section 4: Refactoring
Run 
    python3 buffer_class.py 10 logfile
and verify that it behaves exactly like the previous version 
- as it should, since it is only a refactoring. 

* What are all the classes defined in this version of the file viewer application?
This version of the file viewer app defines the Buffer and BufferApp classes
* What are the factory methods?
The factory methods are _make_window(), _make_buffer(), and _make_cursor().
* Why do you think the author paused here to refactor before fixing the 
bugs in the previous version of the code?
If the author didn't pause to refactor here, then any new additions to the code would require a lot of going back and refactoring pre-existing code.

### Section 5: Clipping
Run
    python3 clip_fixed.py 10 logfile
Verify that the cursor does not move outside the bounds of the text.

* However, there is another bug. What is it? (If necessary, use `CTRL-C` to interrupt the program.)
There is no way to quit the program.
* What are all the classes defined in this version of the file viewer application?
ClipCursorFixed and ClipAppFixed

### Section 6: Viewport
Run
    python3 viewport.py 50 logfile
Verify that you can scroll vertically through the text.
* What are all the classes defined in this version of the file viewer application?
ViewportCursor, ViewportBuffer, and ViewportApp.
* Taking the file viewer application as a whole, do you find the code easy or difficult to read and understand? Why or why not? You might consider Ousterhout's idea of "classitis."
We find it difficult to understand because there are some pretty deeply nesting chains of inheritance that are difficult to follow.

## Exercise 1: Quitting the application

In the file `dispatch_keys.py`, add a method to the `DispatchApp` class so that once again you can type `q` to quit the application.

## Exercise 2: Horizontal scrolling

Modify the application to scroll horizontally as well as vertically.

Rather than creating yet another version of the app with 
yet more child classes, you can modify the code in `viewport.py`

## Exercise 3: Line numbers

Modify the file viewer to show line numbers on the left side of the text.
The line numbers should not move when scrolling horizontally.
